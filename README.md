# 🔄 Matrix Layer Rotation — HackerRank (C Solution)

This repository contains my **C solution** for the HackerRank problem **"Matrix Layer Rotation"**.

📌 **Difficulty:** Medium  
🔗 **Problem Link:** https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/matrix-rotation-algo/problem  

---

## ✅ Problem Summary
Given a matrix, rotate each “layer” (ring) of the matrix **anti-clockwise** by `R` rotations, while maintaining the layered structure.

---

## 🧠 Approach Used
This solution performs:
- Layer detection using distance from matrix borders
- Rotation calculation using modular arithmetic
- Mapping each element directly to its final rotated position

✅ Efficiently handles large matrices within constraints.

## ⚡ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(rows × cols)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(rows × cols)` for the rotated matrix
